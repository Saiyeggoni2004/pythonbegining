Dictionang

we use list, tuple and set to represent a group of individual objects as a single Entity
If we want to represent a group of objects as kay-value pairs then we should go for dictionary.
{key: Value}
Dictionaries can be created using pair of Curly braces({}).
Each item in the dictionary consists of key, followed by a value.
And each item is seperated using commma (,) insertion order is preserved.
NOTE:Duplicate keys are not allowed but values are allowed.
