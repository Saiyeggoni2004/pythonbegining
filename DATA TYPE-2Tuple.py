Tuple in Python â€“ 
Key Points

Definition:
A tuple is a collection of elements grouped as a single entity.

Syntax:
Tuples are defined using parentheses () and elements are separated by commas.
Example:
my_tuple = (94, 67, 12, 88, 62)
Immutable:
Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
When to Use:
Use a tuple when:
You want to represent fixed data.
The data should not change during program execution (e.g., days of the week, coordinates, etc.).
Representation:
Parentheses () are used.
Commas are required between elements.
Note: For a single-element tuple, include a comma:
single_element = (5,)  # Not just (5)
Example:
coordinates = (94, 67, 12, 88, 62)
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 94
